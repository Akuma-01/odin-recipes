        <p>This peri peri chicken is made with my take on African peri peri sauce using fresh and dried chiles. The marinade is incredibly flavorful and gives the chicken a beautiful color as well.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>4 chicken leg/thigh quarters</li>
            <li>4 red Fresno chili peppers, seeded</li>
            <li>kosher salt to taste to season chicken</li>
            <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine garlic, Fresno chili peppers, habanero pepper, bell pepper, smoked paprika, thyme, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, sugar, and onion powder in a blender. </li>
            <li>Pour 3/4 of the marinade into resealable plastic bag set in a bowl. Reserve the rest for serving on the side.</li>
            <li>Make 3 or 4 shallow cuts into the skin side of the chicken quarters. This will allow the sauce to penetrate the skin during marination. Season chicken on both sides with kosher salt</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor charcoal grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade. Set skinside down onto the hot grill, using indirect heat. Cover to keep coals from getting too hot. Cook covered for about 5 minutes, then turn them over and grill another 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with reserved sauce.</li>
        </ol>
